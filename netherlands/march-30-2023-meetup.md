| 1900 - 1930 | Justin Haylo | In order to innovate, we do bold things. We divert, we reimagine, we create. The Web3 space holds countless visionaries, thought leaders, and builders. And everyday, the industry grows in significance. Through the eyes of Wonder Game, we take a look at the ecosystem and the next steps for Web3 gaming projects. We’ve come a long way, so it’s time to pause and reflect. Look beyond Web3. Or, look back to see how far we’ve come. And what we’ve left behind. Instead of venturing into the unknown, we may need to revisit fast relationships. Remove entry barriers and enable traditional players to enjoin the benefit of decentralization. Hence the title, ‘’Breaking out of Web3’’. Was this clickbait? Yes. Is it still an interesting topic that I’d gladly ramble on about? Also Yes.  | [WonderGame](https://wonderdotgame.medium.com/wonderland-character-story-queen-beb0c93f9120) |
